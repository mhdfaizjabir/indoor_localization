#  Indoor Localization using Wi-Fi Fingerprinting

Dataset - https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/422/wireless+indoor+localization

This project solves the problem of **indoor localization** by predicting both:
- **Coordinates** (longitude & latitude) using regression
- **Building and floor** using classification

It uses **Wi-Fi signal strengths** from over 500 Access Points and applies various machine learning models, including **KNN**, **Neural Networks**, **Decision Trees**, and **CNNs**, along with **PCA** for dimensionality reduction.

##  Objectives

- Predict indoor **coordinates** via regression
- Predict **building** and **floor level** via classification
- Apply **PCA** for dimensionality reduction (520 ‚ûù 267 features)
- Evaluate and tune KNN, Decision Tree, and CNN models
